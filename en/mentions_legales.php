The necropolis, home to royal tombs and impressive funerary structures, is a unique testimony to the spirituality and funerary rituals of Pharaonic Egypt. This project aims to make this exceptional heritage accessible through a modern, interactive website, enabling visitors from all over the world to discover and explore this treasure trove of humanity.</p>
